		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, we implemented de Casteljau subdivision for Bezier curves and Loop subdivision for meshes. In Section 1, we developed the de Casteljau algorithm for both Bezier curves and surfaces. In Section 2, we implemented various operations for handling mesh elements/data, such as area-weighted vertex normals for smooth shading, edge flips and splits, and loop subdivision for subdividing and "smoothing out" meshes. Implementing these features and algorithms provided us insight into the behind-the-scenes of 3D meshes. We learned how the specific data structures of mesh data are structured and used, as well as how complex certain "simple" operations seem, such as flipping or splitting an edge. 		
		
		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		
		De Casteljau’s subdivision algorithm is a recursive algorithm for evaluating a Bezier curve at a given parameter (t). At a high level, the algorithm recursively subdivides the control points of the curve until there is only one point left. We implemented by using a for-loop to iterate over the current vector of control points and calculate the linearly interpolated (lerped) points using the formula ((1.0 - t) * points[i]) + (t * points[i + 1]). The variable 't' represents the interpolation parameter between 0 and 1. The lerped points are stored in a new vector and we repeat the process until there's only one point left, which is the final point on the Bezier curve at the given parameter 't'.

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		De Casteljau’s algorithm extends to Bezier Surfaces similarly to how it applies to Bezier Curves. Essentially, you apply the algorithm twice, once using the u parameter on the control points, and once again using the v parameter on the resulting control points. This is effectively performing a linear interpolation across the surface defined by the control points. This means, essentially, that you are performing step by step iteration calculating points in the direction of u and then in the direction of v until you arrive at the desired point on the surface.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		To implement the area weighted vertex normals, we first calculated the area of the input vertices' triangle. We did this by first obtaining the location of the three vertices that made up the triangle, and then calcuating two edges by subtracting the vertices from each other. We then, finally, got the area of the triangle by taking half of the magnitude of the cross product of the two edges we obtained earlier. To get the final area weighted vertex normal, we multiplied the area by the normalized cross product of the two edges we calculated earlier.

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>

		We implemented the edge flip operation by changing the pointers in the half-edge data structure to essentially switch the vertical split to be horizontal by changing the vertices in which the two triangles were connected by. Before they were connected by the vertical (top and bottom) vertices, and after being flipped they are connected by the two horizontal (left and right) vertices.

		<br></br>

		First, we collected all the necessary mesh elements, including the half-edges, vertices, and faces. We also checked if the edge was a boundary edge, and if it was, we would immediately return the current edge since boundary edges cannot be flipped.

		<br></br>

		We then updated all the pointers. We started by changing the initial verticies of the vertical split half-edge and twin. Since changing the split from vertical to horizontal changed the triangles, we then updated the half-edge pointers for the vertices for the two newly updated triangle.  Finally, we updated the face pointers for all half-edges for each triangle and all half-edge pointers for the faces.

		<br></br>

		While we had the logic for the edge flip operation down, we spent most of the time debugging the variable names and order of operations. We had accidentally mixed up the vertical and horizontal splits and thus had to rewrite all the edge/vertices orders.

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		The journey to implement edge splitting was quite a long, rocky road. Originally, we tried to manually handle every new half edge pointer reassignment but eventually switched to using the built in setNeighbors() function. 
		To implement edge splitting, we first started by coming up with a creative and intuitive naming convention for our variables to make it easy to make calls to setNeighbors and not make any naive mistakes such as overriding a pointer. 
		We created variables for every vertex, edge, face and halfedge for the original mesh. Then, using the newVertex() function, we created a new vertex at the midpoint of the two vertices that made up edge e0. This was where our split line was going to intersect. 
		Then, using newEdge(), newFace(), and newHalfedge(), we created 6 new halfedges, 2 new faces, and 3 new edges to account for the new pointers we were going to have to handle. Once we had everything in place, we went face by face making calls to setNeighbors() for all the half edges. Our naming convention came in handy here as we were able to make sure we were using the right objects in every call. 

		<br></br>

		For debugging tricks, we added print statements in several places throughout the function to make sure the function wasn’t erroring anywhere along the way. 
		We also added boolean checks to make sure that certain objects weren’t equal to each other throughout the function. This made sure we were not overriding any previous pointers we had already handled.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>

		We implemented the loop subdivision using the 5 steps given to us. We computed all the new positions for all original vertices with their respective u-values (either 3/16 or 3/8n). We then calculated all the new positions for the edge midpoints by using the weighted formula. Finally, we split all original edges and flipped the newly-created edges that connect the old and new vertices. One interesting implementation we used was using the isNew properties to label and keep track of which vertices/edges are new and old. This really helped with both debugging and also avoiding any logical errors.

		After subdividing the teapot mesh/object, we noticed the sharp corners and edges became more and more smooth/rounded with each iteration. You can see the teapot had sharp corners like in the spout because it's supposed to be curved (and due to the low poly count). As the mesh is subdivided, you can see the sharp edges smooth out as the polygon count increases. (Fun fact, this is a feature in Blender where you can increase the "mean crease" of one or more edges which will cause that edge to maintain its original "crease" or sharpness as you subdivide the mesh).
